# About the App
This is web app made with ASP NET Core and Blazor Server. The main purpose of this app is to allow me to learn by practice. I've applied the things I learned and picked up a ton of new things on the way relating to security, databases, migrations and UI components.

# Disclaimer
I would like to mention a few things here:
  1. This is a side project meant for practice. It's not a real-world app.
  2. The UI is not the prettiest, but that's okay because:
      - It's not meant to be used by the public.
      - The app serves its purpose for me because it's functional.
      - I lean more towards back-end, though I am still competent with implementing front-end.
  3. I don't plan to work on this app any longer, as I will use my limited time on other projects.
